# Git Instructions (Intent-Based)

This repository uses **GitHub-native features** for PR automation:

- On every **Pull Request**, GitHub Actions:
  - Run lint, tests, and security scans.
  - Summarize changes and record metrics.
  - Store results in JSON + Markdown dashboards.

## Usage
1. Create a new branch and push changes.
2. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
3. CI/CD will run and update `docs/dashboard.json` + `docs/dashboard.md`.
4. Dashboard auto-updates with risk score, test results, and build time.

## Merge Flow
- Reviewers see:
  - âœ… Tests & security results
  - ðŸ“Š Risk score & metrics
  - ðŸ“„ PR summary
- Reviewer **approves/rejects** manually.
- Auto-merge if low-risk + tests pass.
